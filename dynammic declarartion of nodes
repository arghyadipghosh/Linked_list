when a node is declaraed statically:

e.g:

node* input()
{
int data;
cin>>data;
node *head=NULL;
while(data!=-1)             // SO HERE node n is declared statically it simply means that the scope of the node will exist until one taravrsal of the loop
{                          // so after the first traversal of the loop the scope of the first node gets deleted  which becomes a problem and so the declaration of node 
node n(data);               // dynamiccally is required

if(head==NULL){
head=&n;
}
}


dynammic decalaration of nodE:

e.g.:
node* input()
{
int data;
cin>>data;
node *head=NULL;
while(data!=-1)            
{                          
node n=new node(data);               

if(head==NULL){
head=n;
}
}
